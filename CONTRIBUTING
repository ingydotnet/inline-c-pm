Contributing
============

This file lists the software and systems that currently contribute to
the Inline::C project. It is recommended that you become familiar with
these if you intend to contribute to this project.

GitHub
------

The code for this project is hosted at GitHub. The URL is:

Swim
----

The documentation for this project, such as the C-Cookbook, is written
in (.swim) format. When working with (.swim) format files we recommend
installing the Swim module.

  perldoc Swim

gives you a detailed description of the (.swim) format.
To generate a preview of a (.swim) document, you can convert it to
(.pod) format using the "swim" utility program. Again using the C-Cookbook
as an example, the command to use would be;

  swim --to=pod Cookbook.swim > Cookbook.pod

Then use the command "perldoc Cookbook.pod" to view the formatted
document.
